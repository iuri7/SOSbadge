# SOSbadge
App for security badge
This website is my final project for my Code Louisville class.
The goal of this website/portal is to create a foundation for the development of a real world commercial application to be commercialized by VesCo Solutions,LLC.
The portal shall give a overview of the functionality and use of our SOS Badge and SafeKeeper software; in the future this will be integrated to the backend firmware and
hardware capabilities.
In regards of the project requirements and its completion, please find guidance below:

Final project requirements & options choice:

Built mobile first- I develop the site for mobile size screen as a foundation.

2 media queries that change layout with visible changes from mobile to PC - I created to media queries: 1 for large screens at 1024px and 1 for tablets tablet screens at 768px.

Get uploaded to GitHub- my project it was fully uploaded and pull verified on a 2nd devide for quality control.

ReadMe with description of the use of the site. - created.

Your required 5 commits is only a minimum. We hope to see dozens or hundreds of commits. I completed the minimum of creating the 5+ git commits.
3+ features:

CSS
Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop
= I used flexbox to change the orientation from column to row for different screen sizes, as well changed graphics orientations like the "techinfo", "cardsteps", logo location.

A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item
= I created a hamburger menu for our price packages and website navigation menu.

Java Script

Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section)
= I created a contact us form with parameters of confirmation for phone number and email. As well as a response message " Thank you for interest on our SOS Badge. We will get back
to you shortly"

Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction.
= our navigation menu is a clickable hidden menu.

Please let me know if any question.
