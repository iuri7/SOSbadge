# SOSbadge
Portal for security badge info
This website is my final project for my Code Louisville class.
The goal of this website/portal is to create a foundation for the development of a real world commercial application to be commercialized by VesCo Solutions,LLC.
The portal shall give a overview of the functionality and use of our SOS Badge and SafeKeeper software. in the future this will be integrated to the backend firmware and
hardware capabilities.
This Website features:
1- A pop up navigation menu which is activate by the 2 arrows on the right or left side of the screen depending on the size of your screen.  the options can link you to different parts of the page
2- 2 media queries: 1 for tablets (768px) and 1 for larger screens (1024px)
3- a contact form. The form can be activated by pressing the contact us button and can be submited by pressing submit. ( doesn't submit to a server yet)
4- offers a pop up message to confirm submition after the submit button on the contact form is press.
5- it offers images change and text layout according to different screen sizes- such as steps image and price layout.
