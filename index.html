        Every one of us has a wish to protect and keep our loved ones safe at all times;  
        however, until now that has been challenging.
        With that in mind, VesCo Solutions created a device to put our minds at ease by
        providing a fast and accurate way to inform the proper authorities to come help
        our loved ones based on their emergency. 
        All that is done with the press of a button, using our SOS Cards.
        The SOS Card is a wearable. It can be used by teachers, employees, students, 
        neighborhood watches, and many other possible users, to send a message
        with an exact location to a security office or across the entire facility - 
        providing the exact spot where the help should go.
        The SOS message can be sent to security systems for an automatic activation of alarms
        and / or to a remote location inside or outside the premises to ensure the reach of proper help.
